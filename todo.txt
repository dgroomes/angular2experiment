- use docker?
- do something with service worker
- CSS Modules?
- front end dev server should proxy "api" requests; redirect to back end (depends on: make the back end)
- umm, app.js is > 13MB in size... how that? investigate
- Swagger documentation

Done
- make solution to not put build artifacts alongside source. I.e., don't put compiled Javascript next to the source Typescript. src != target
- Webpack? (I probably want to use a higher lever build system than just the "scripts" property of package.json and my own ad hoc scripts
- webpack-dev-server? is this viable as a front end dev server? can I configure it to route certain requests to my java backend? (my interest for some of these todo's is coming from https://github.com/Mercateo/component-check btw)
- seriously polish that webpack.config.js... how does it even work?
- do i really need a vendor.js? rather just put it in app.js
- make Spring Boot back end
